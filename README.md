# Bot Algorithms

This is an experiment using KorGE and classic AI algorithms for bot programming for visualization of how the algorithms work.

Currently it includes:
- Path finding with A*: draw your dungeon, merge the rooms, create the navmesh, search for the best path between the starting an end point, and optimize the path using the funnel algorithm.

Special thanks to the amazing clipper library and it's authors and translators:
- Bala R. Vatti: algorithm author
- Angus Johnson (github: AngusJohnson): implementation for C++, C# & Delphi
- Alexey Cherepanov (github: alexej520): translated from C# to Kotlin
- Michael Muehlhaus (github: Monkey-Maestro): made it multiplatform removing dependencies to the JVM
